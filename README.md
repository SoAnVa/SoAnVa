# 👋 Welcome to Anatole Vakili's GitHub

Hi, I’m Anatole Vakili, an engineer by training with a passion for machine learning, LLMs (Large Language Models), and transformers. I hold an engineering degree from ISAE-SUPAERO and am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Mathematics, Vision, and Learning (MVA) at ENS Paris-Saclay.

This GitHub showcases my journey through various projects spanning both machine learning and my earlier work in mechanical engineering. Here’s an overview of my key projects:

## 🔷 Projects

### 1. **🃏 MistrallBluff: An LLM for Poker**
- **Description**: This project focuses on building an LLM (Large Language Model) capable of playing poker. It explores the strategic and probabilistic aspects of poker.
- **Highlights**: The model is designed to learn bluffing strategies and complex poker moves through LLM finetuning.

### 2. **📓 Interactive Notebook for Exploring EDM**
- **Description**: This notebook is an interactive exploration of Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models (EDM). It provides a hands-on interface for experimenting with various diffusion model sampling techniques.
- **Highlights**: It serves as a comprehensive tool for understanding the core mechanisms of generative models, with both deterministic and stochastic sampling techniques.

### 3. **🌍 Kaggle Competition: Methane Plume Detection**
- **Description**: A project from my work on a Kaggle competition, focusing on detecting methane plumes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to optimize detection accuracy to aid in environmental monitoring.
- **Highlights**: This project involves handling large datasets, building models for environmental sustainability, and tackling the challenges of plume detection from satellite imagery.

### 4. **🔧 FEM Code in Fortran**
- **Description**: During my earlier studies in mechanical engineering, I developed a full Finite Element Method (FEM) code in Fortran. This project reflects my background in mechanics and computational methods.
- **Highlights**: A complete FEM solver capable of analyzing structural mechanics problems, highlighting my foundational expertise in engineering before transitioning to AI and machine learning.

## 🌟 What I’m Currently Working On
- **📝 ESRS Gap Analysis**: A personal project focused on the gap analysis for the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).
- **⚙️ LLMs & Transformers**: Continuing my deep dive into LLMs and transformers, applying them across different domains.
